## Subcategories

- **Annual Reports** -- Public company financial reports and investor documents
- **SEC Filings** -- 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, proxy statements, insider transactions
- **Company Profiles** -- Registration data, officers, addresses across jurisdictions
- **Employee / Executive Research** -- LinkedIn X-Ray, professional profiles, org charts
- **International Registries** -- UK, EU, Russian, Swiss, and global company registers
- **Corporate Relationships** -- Board memberships, political donations, power networks
- **Patents / Trademarks** -- Intellectual property associated with companies

## Investigation Workflow

1. **Identify the entity**: Search OpenCorporates for registration details across jurisdictions
2. **US public companies**: Query SEC EDGAR for financial filings (10-K, 10-Q, insider trades)
3. **UK companies**: Check Companies House for officers, filing history, charges
4. **Funding / startup**: Search Crunchbase for investment rounds, investors, acquisitions
5. **Annual reports**: Download from AnnualReports.com for financial narrative
6. **EU companies**: Use Company Data Rex, Europages, or VIES VAT validation
7. **Relationships**: Map power networks via LittleSis (board memberships, donors)
8. **Employee enumeration**: Use RecruitEm for LinkedIn X-Ray searches
9. **Cross-reference**: Pivot to `domain-recon` for company websites, `compliance-risk` for sanctions

## curl / API Patterns

### SEC EDGAR -- Step 1: Find Company CIK (no key required)

```bash
# Look up CIK from company name using the tickers file
COMPANY="canadian imperial bank"
curl -s "https://www.sec.gov/files/company_tickers.json" \
  -H "User-Agent: OSINTFramework research@osint.local" \
  | jq --arg q "$COMPANY" '[to_entries[].value | select(.title | ascii_downcase | test($q))]'
```

### SEC EDGAR -- Step 2: Get Filings by CIK (no key required)

```bash
# Replace CIK with the value from Step 1 (zero-padded to 10 digits)
CIK="0001045520"
curl -s "https://data.sec.gov/submissions/CIK${CIK}.json" \
  -H "User-Agent: OSINTFramework research@osint.local" \
  | jq '{name, cik, tickers, exchanges, sic, sicDescription, filings: {forms: .filings.recent.form[:10], dates: .filings.recent.filingDate[:10]}}'
```

### OpenCorporates -- Company Search (API key required)

```bash
if [ -n "${OPENCORPORATES_API_KEY:-}" ]; then
  curl -s "https://api.opencorporates.com/v0.4/companies/search?q=acme+corp&api_token=${OPENCORPORATES_API_KEY}" \
    | jq '.results.companies[] | {name: .company.name, jurisdiction: .company.jurisdiction_code, status: .company.current_status}'
else
  echo "[skip] OpenCorporates requires API key (set OPENCORPORATES_API_KEY)"
fi
```

### Companies House UK -- Company Details (API key required)

```bash
if [ -n "${COMPANIES_HOUSE_API_KEY:-}" ]; then
  curl -s "https://api.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/00000001" \
    -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n "${COMPANIES_HOUSE_API_KEY}:" | base64)" \
    | jq '{company_name, company_status, type, date_of_creation, registered_office_address}'
else
  echo "[skip] Companies House requires API key (set COMPANIES_HOUSE_API_KEY)"
fi
```

### Domain Inference

When investigating a company, infer the likely domain and pivot:

```bash
# Infer domain from company name, then run domain-recon
COMPANY_DOMAIN="cibc.com"  # inferred from company name
whois "$COMPANY_DOMAIN" 2>/dev/null | grep -iE '(registra|creation|expir|name server)' | head -10
dig "$COMPANY_DOMAIN" A +short
subfinder -d "$COMPANY_DOMAIN" -silent -rls 5 | head -20
```

### EU VIES -- VAT Number Validation

```bash
curl -s "https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/rest-api/ms/DE/vat/123456789" \
  | jq '{valid, name, address}'
```

### LittleSis -- Entity Relationships

```bash
curl -s "https://littlesis.org/api/entities/search?q=goldman+sachs" \
  | jq '.data[] | {name: .attributes.name, type: .attributes.primary_ext, blurb: .attributes.blurb}'
```

## Cross-Category Pivots

| When you find... | Pivot to | Why |
|------------------|----------|-----|
| Company domain in filings | `domain-recon` | WHOIS, DNS, subdomains, technology stack |
| Officers or executives | `people-search` | Personal records, social profiles |
| Sanctions or regulatory flags | `compliance-risk` | OFAC, PEP screening, beneficial ownership |
| Company address | `geolocation` | Verify physical location, satellite imagery |
| Court cases in filings | `public-records` | Detailed dockets, opinions, outcomes |
| Intellectual property | `public-records` | USPTO patent details, Google Patents |

## OPSEC Notes

- Most tools are **passive** -- no target notification
- LinkedIn and XING are **active** -- profile views may be logged
- SEC EDGAR requires a User-Agent header with contact email (policy, not authentication)
- Companies House API requires free registration; usage is tracked
- Crunchbase API requires registration and has rate limits
- OpenCorporates free tier has limited API calls; consider caching results
- RecruitEm generates Google dork queries -- the Google search itself is logged
- Use research-dedicated accounts for registration-required services
