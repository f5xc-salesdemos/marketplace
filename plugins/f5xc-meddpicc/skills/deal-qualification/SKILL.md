# MEDDPICC Deal Qualification

Produce an evidence-based MEDDPICC scorecard for a deal. Walk through
each element, score it, identify gaps, and recommend next actions.

## Initialization

Ask the user to provide deal context. If they provide partial
information, work with what's available and flag the gaps.

## Scoring Protocol

For each MEDDPICC element, assess the evidence and assign a score:

| Score | Label | Meaning |
| ----- | ----- | ------- |
| 3 | **Strong** | Verified evidence from customer; multiple data points |
| 2 | **Developing** | Partial evidence; some assumptions remain |
| 1 | **Weak** | Minimal evidence; mostly assumptions |
| 0 | **Unknown** | No evidence or not yet explored |

## Scoring Rubric

Refer to [scoring-rubric.md](references/scoring-rubric.md) for
detailed scoring criteria for each element.

## Output Format

Produce the scorecard in this exact structure:

```
## MEDDPICC Deal Scorecard

### Deal: [deal name or account]
### Date: [today's date]
### Stage: [current deal stage]
### Overall Score: [X/24]

---

| Element | Score | Evidence Summary | Key Gap |
| ------- | ----- | ---------------- | ------- |
| Metrics | X/3 | [brief] | [gap or "None"] |
| Economic Buyer | X/3 | [brief] | [gap or "None"] |
| Decision Criteria | X/3 | [brief] | [gap or "None"] |
| Decision Process | X/3 | [brief] | [gap or "None"] |
| Paper Process | X/3 | [brief] | [gap or "None"] |
| Identify Pain | X/3 | [brief] | [gap or "None"] |
| Champion | X/3 | [brief] | [gap or "None"] |
| Competition | X/3 | [brief] | [gap or "None"] |

### Risk Assessment

[Overall deal risk level: Low / Medium / High / Critical]
[Key risk factors and their potential impact]

### Top 3 Gaps to Close

1. **[Element]** — [specific gap and why it matters]
   - **Next action:** [specific action]
   - **Owner:** [role]
   - **By when:** [timeframe]

2. **[Element]** — [gap]
   - **Next action:** [action]
   - **Owner:** [role]
   - **By when:** [timeframe]

3. **[Element]** — [gap]
   - **Next action:** [action]
   - **Owner:** [role]
   - **By when:** [timeframe]

### Forecast Recommendation

[Commit / Best Case / Pipeline / At Risk]
[Justification based on evidence]
```

## Scoring Guidelines

- **18–24:** Strong deal — forecast as Commit if Decision Process
  and Paper Process are both 3
- **12–17:** Developing deal — forecast as Best Case with clear
  gap-closing plan
- **6–11:** Early deal — forecast as Pipeline; significant work
  needed
- **0–5:** At risk — qualify out or fundamentally re-approach

## Coaching Behavior

After presenting the scorecard:

1. Highlight the single most critical gap
2. Suggest specific discovery questions to close the top gaps
3. Recommend which team member should own each action
4. Flag any anti-patterns you observe
