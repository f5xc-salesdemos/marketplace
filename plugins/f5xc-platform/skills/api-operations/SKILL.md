  Spec-aware API CRUD operations for F5 Distributed Cloud platform resources.
  Covers 98 resource types across 38 domains with precise endpoints, payload
  templates, dependency ordering, and multi-step workflow compositions.
  Use when user wants to list, get, create, update, delete, or deploy any
  F5 XC resource via API — including HTTP load balancers, origin pools,
  WAF policies, DNS zones, certificates, cloud sites, and more. Also use
  for multi-step deployments like "deploy an HTTPS load balancer with WAF"
  or "set up a DNS zone with records." Even if the user doesn't say "API"
  explicitly, if they want to create, configure, or manage platform resources,
  this skill provides the spec knowledge the api-operator agent needs.
compatibility: Requires curl, jq, and network access to F5 XC tenant API
user-invocable: false

# API Operations

This skill gives the `api-operator` agent precise knowledge of F5 XC API
endpoints, request schemas, dependencies, and multi-step workflows. It does
this through generated reference files that the agent reads on demand.

## How It Works

1. **You** (main session) identify the resource and operation from the user's request
2. **You** look up the resource in the routing table below to find its domain and profile path
3. **You** delegate to the `api-operator` agent, telling it which reference files to read
4. **The agent** reads the files, constructs the API call(s), and executes them

All reference files live under `skills/api-operations/references/`.

## Operation Types

### Single-Resource CRUD

For list, get, create, update, or delete operations on a single resource:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="f5xc-platform:api-operator",
  description="<verb> <resource> via API",
  prompt="Read these reference files first:
  1. skills/api-operations/references/domains/<domain>.md
  2. skills/api-operations/references/resources/<domain>/<resource>.md

  Then: <VERB> <RESOURCE> in namespace <NS>.
  User parameters: <any specifics the user provided>

  Use the resource profile for exact endpoints and payload construction.
  Environment: F5XC_API_URL, F5XC_API_TOKEN, F5XC_NAMESPACE"
)
```

### Multi-Resource Workflows

For "deploy", "set up", "provision", or any request involving multiple
dependent resources, check the `references/workflows/` directory first:

| Workflow | File | Trigger |
| ---------- | ------ | --------- |
| Deploy HTTP LB | `workflows/deploy_http_loadbalancer.md` | "deploy HTTP LB", "create LB with pool" |
| Deploy HTTPS LB | `workflows/deploy_https_loadbalancer.md` | "deploy HTTPS LB", "LB with TLS/SSL" |
| Enable WAF | `workflows/enable_waf_protection.md` | "add WAF to LB", "enable WAF" |
| Configure DNS | `workflows/configure_dns_zone.md` | "set up DNS zone", "configure DNS" |
| Enable CDN | `workflows/enable_cdn_distribution.md` | "enable CDN", "set up CDN" |
| Configure Origin Pool | `workflows/configure_origin_pool.md` | "set up origin pool with health checks" |
| Register Site | `workflows/register_site.md` | "register site", "add CE site" |

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="f5xc-platform:api-operator",
  description="Deploy <resource> via API workflow",
  prompt="Read these reference files first:
  1. skills/api-operations/references/workflows/<workflow_id>.md
  2. For each step's resource, read: skills/api-operations/references/resources/<domain>/<resource>.md

  Then: Execute the workflow in namespace <NS>.
  User parameters: <specifics>

  Create resources in dependency order. Pass resource names between steps.
  Environment: F5XC_API_URL, F5XC_API_TOKEN, F5XC_NAMESPACE"
)
```

If no workflow matches, use the domain catalog's dependency graph and
creation order to determine the sequence.

### Custom Actions

For non-CRUD actions (get security config, assign API definitions, etc.),
read the resource profile's "Additional Endpoints" section.

## Alias Resolution

`references/domains/<domain>.md` to discover all resources in that domain.

## Gotchas

- F5 XC uses `POST` for **both** create and list operations on some
  endpoints. The resource profile distinguishes them — create endpoints
  have `{metadata.namespace}` in the path, list endpoints have `{namespace}`.
- Mutually exclusive groups use empty objects `{}` as values, not booleans.
  For example, `"disable_waf": {}` not `"disable_waf": true`.
- Resource names must be DNS labels: lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens,
  max 63 chars, cannot start or end with a hyphen. The API returns a
  cryptic 400 error if this is violated.
- Some domains use a path prefix before `/namespaces/` — for example,
  DNS uses `/api/config/dns/namespaces/` not `/api/config/namespaces/`.
  Always use the exact path from the resource profile.
- The `origin_pool` resource appears in both the `virtual` and
  `service_mesh` domains with different schemas. Use the `virtual`
  domain version for HTTP/TCP load balancers.
- When referencing another resource (e.g., attaching a WAF to an LB),
  use the format `{"name": "resource-name", "namespace": "ns"}` not
  just the name string.
- The API returns 409 (Conflict) if a resource with the same name
  already exists. Check existence with a GET first if unsure.
