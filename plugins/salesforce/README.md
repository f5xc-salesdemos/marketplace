# Salesforce Plugin

Container-adapted Salesforce CLI integration for Claude Code. Provides
org authentication, account management, pipeline analysis, and natural
language data queries. Bridges to the official
[forcedotcom/afv-library](https://github.com/forcedotcom/afv-library)
skills for Salesforce development.

## Prerequisites

- **Salesforce CLI** (`@salesforce/cli`): `brew install sf` or
  `npm install -g @salesforce/cli`
- **afv-library skills** (optional): `npx skills add forcedotcom/afv-library`
- **Salesforce org** with API access

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check CLI and org status
/salesforce:sf-status

# Authenticate to an org
/salesforce:sf-login my-org
```

## Authentication

### Workstation (browser available)

Find your Salesforce domain from your browser URL
(`https://acme.lightning.force.com` means your domain is
`acme.my.salesforce.com`), then run:

```bash
sf org login web --alias my-org --set-default --instance-url https://YOUR-DOMAIN.my.salesforce.com
```

### Container / headless (no browser)

Export the SFDX auth URL from an authenticated workstation:

```bash
sf org display --verbose --target-org my-org
```

Copy the `Sfdx Auth Url` value, then in the container:

```bash
echo "$SFDX_AUTH_URL" | sf org login sfdx-url --sfdx-url-stdin=- --alias=my-org --set-default
```

### All authentication methods

| Method       | Best For                      | Command                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |

| JWT Bearer   | Automated pipelines           | `sf org login jwt`          |
| Access Token | Environment variable auth     | `sf org login access-token` |

**Note:** Device flow (`sf org login device`) is blocked since August
2025.
